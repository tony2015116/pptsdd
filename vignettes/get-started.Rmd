# Description of your package

# download_free_hands()

This is the first function of our package. You can free up you hands and download pig performance test station data using function `download_free_hands()`.


```{=html}
<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->
```

```{=html}
<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->
```

```{r examples-download_free_hands}
user_name = "隆鑫场测定一区"
stations = "101"
download_date = "2023-02-11"
download_free_hands(location = stations, 
                    data_date = download_date, 
                    url = Sys.getenv("web_url"), 
                    username = user_name, 
                    password = Sys.getenv("user_password"))

```

```{=html}
<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->
```

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.

# download_free_brain

    

  

```{r example-download_free_brain}
user_name = "隆鑫场测定一区"
stations = purrr::map_chr(seq(101L,103L,1L), c)
download_date = seq(as.Date("2023-02-01"),as.Date("2023-02-03"),1)
download_free_brain(location = stations, 
                    data_date = download_date, 
                    url = Sys.getenv("web_url"), 
                    username = user_name, 
                    password = Sys.getenv("user_password"))
