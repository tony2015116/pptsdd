Run this 'development' chunk

Store every call to library() that you need to run chunks line by line, as in a classical Rmd for analysis

<!--

# Description of your package

This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else. 

Note: when you will use other flat templates, this part will be in a separate file. Do not be surprised!
--> 


# Add one to any value

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. 
You can add `1` to any `value` using function `add_one()`.

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->


```{r examples-download_by_hand}
web_ppt1 <- "https://yxlxppt01.vpu-online.cn/login/LoginPage.web"
username1 <- "隆鑫场测定一区"
password1 <- "yangxianglongxin1234"
station_create5 <- purrr::map_chr(seq(101L,102L,1L), c)
download_by_hand(location = station_create5, 
                 data_date = "2023-02-11", 
                 url = web_ppt1, 
                 username = username1, 
                 password = password1)

```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->


That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.

<!-- 

# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()` 
-->



<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
