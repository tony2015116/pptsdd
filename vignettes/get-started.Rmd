# Description of your package

# download_csv_auto

This is the first function of our package. You can free up you hands and download pig performance test station data using function `download_csv_auto()`.


```{=html}
<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->
```

```{=html}
<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->
```

```{r examples-download_csv_auto}
stations = c("1801","1802")
data_date = c("2023-03-29","2023-03-30")
download_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/"
save_path = "C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/test/"

download_csv_auto(url = Sys.getenv("web_url"), 
                  username = Sys.getenv("user_name"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("user_password"),
                  csv_position = "1",
                  location = stations, 
                  data_date = data_date, 
                  download_path = download_path,
                  save_path = save_path)

```

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.
